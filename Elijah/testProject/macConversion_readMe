I had to start usign my mac as my VM was showing signs of failure.
key differences between mac and linux causing build to fail.

this is the documentation on how to clone the repo for user login, create
a database, connect to it, install postgres, create credentials. 



1) clone the repo
git clone 

2) delete the node-modules folder
rm -rf node_modules

3) do a node -v check and make sure its 10.12.0
node -v

4) if its not then do 
nvm install 10.12.0

5) npm install 
	to reinit the node_modules for the current OS

6) set up postgres on mac with same credentials

7)postgres version check 10.6

8) configure postgres
psql postgres 

well this is going terribly i can't create a user and not sure how to 
give environmental variables for connection host and user?
