### Summary
This web application will search for an appropriate Spotify playlist to match
the current ambient air temperature  at a given location. The user must register 
a user name and password, then login to view the music search interface. Once loggedin,
user can enter a city and a Spotify playlist will load according to the ambient
temperature. For example, if the termpature is greater than 70 degress F summer
themed music will play. If the termperature is lower than 30 degrees F, colder
theemed music would be loaded.
