User inputs a location, a request is made to Open Weather to fetch the temperature, 
a query is made to fetch a playlist stored in a database and then displayed to the user using EJS.

I completed  - 
    request to the API to get the temperature of the location given by the user
    the creation and linking of the database that will hold the playlists
    created a condition that will determine which table to pull the playlist from
    wrote the query to get the playlist
    rendered the EJS to display the new data
