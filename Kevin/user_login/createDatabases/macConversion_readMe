I had to start usign my mac as my VM was showing signs of failure.
key differences between mac and linux causing build to fail.

this is the documentation on how to clone the repo for user login, create
a database, connect to it, install postgres, create credentials. 



1) clone the repo
git clone 

2) delete the node-modules folder
rm -rf node_modules

3) do a node -v check and make sure its 10.12.0
node -v

4) if its not then do 
nvm install 10.12.0

5) npm install 
	to reinit the node_modules for the current OS

6) set up postgres on mac with same credentials

7)postgres version check 10.6

8) configure postgres
psql postgres 

9) set up the sysadmin user in postgres pw 12345 port 5432 
host:127.0.0.1


Note: this only covers the actual user acceptance testing. not the regression or
automated testing


To see a demo refer to the milestone7 pdf with a link to a google drive video.
