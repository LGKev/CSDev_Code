This directory houses all the work that I have done towards the project
any notes or mini projects started.


the important script is the createTemperatureRangeTables.js which
will create 3 tables add them to the database we have built.
then we will add a link to a song to each database. 

the next person to itterate on this should make the irefs be legit playlist links instead.
